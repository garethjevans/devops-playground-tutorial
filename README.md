# Introduction
On this meetup, we will walk you through creating a Jenkins X cluster on GKE, creating an application using a Jenkins X quickstart, pushing the application into a staging environment.

# Setup

For this workshop we are going to utilise Google Cloud Shell to create our Jenkins X cluster on top of GKE.  We have two options available to us for getting access to Google Cloud Shell.

## Option 1: Register for a GCP Trial account (Recommended)

Google offer a trial account with $300 of free credit.  You will require a Credit / Debit card to sign up but this will not be charged.  To sign up follow [these instructions](https://cloud.google.com/free/).

## Option 2: 

TODO

* Hub CLI

# Launch Cloud Shell

Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Once you have logged in, click on the Activate Cloud Shell button in the top right of the screen.

This may take a few minutes if this is the first time you've launched cloudshell. Once complete, you should see the following terminal:

# Download Dependencies

All of the required dependencies for this workshop will be downloaded & installed directly into Google Cloud Shell.

```
curl -L https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/v2.0.230/jx-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xzv
sudo mv jx /usr/local/bin
```

Check that the `jx` binary is correctly installed

```
jx --version
$ 2.0.230
```

## Create Cluster

Ensure you are logged in:
```
$ gcloud auth login
```

If you are using the shared project, if you don’t have enough credit:
```
$ gcloud config set project jenkins-x-workshop
```

Create a new GKE cluster and install Jenkins X:
```
$ jx create cluster gke --ng --skip-login -n my-name
```

* If you are prompted for the GKE project, select the `jenkins-x-workshop`
* Select the zone that is nearest - I'd suggest one of the `europe-west` zones

We will default a number of options, to override this, use the `--advanced` flag when creating the cluster.

```
Defaulting to machine type: n1-standard-2
Defaulting to minimum number of nodes: 3
Defaulting to maxiumum number of nodes: 5
Defaulting use of preemptible VMs: No
Defaulting access to Google Cloud Storage / Google Container Registry: Yes
Defaulting enabling Cloud Build, Container Registry & Container Analysis API's: Yes
```

It can take around 5 minutes to create the cluster, once this has completed the installation process will automatically kick in.

```
// TODO validate if any apis need be created on a completely fresh project (cloud resource manager)
```

When prompted for the domain, select the default.

Select the JX namespace
```
jx ns jx
```

View all deployments

```
$ kubectl get deployments
```

View all pods

```
kubectl get pods
```

## Create an Application

Next we're going to use a `quickstart` to an application. To do this run the following:

```
jx create quickstart
```

TODO add in selection options

Watch the build logs

```
jx get build logs
```

Make a change to the application

Install the HUB Cli

TODO need instructions for CloudShell

```
brew install hub
hub version
```

```
cd <application>
git checkout -b wip
vi main.go
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: updated welcome message"
git push origin wip
hub pull-request
```

View Preview Environments:
$ jx get preview

```
$ jx get environments
$ jx get pipelines
$ jx start pipeline
$ jx get build logs -w
$ jx get activity
$ jx create quickstart -l Go
$ jx get build logs -f <project-name>
$ jx get activity -f <project-name>
$ jx get applications

Promote to production environment:
$ jx get applications
$ jx promote my-app --version 0.0.1 --env production

Check whether the application was promoted:
$ jx get applications
```

## Cleanup
Delete the GKE cluster:

```
$ gcloud container clusters delete <cluster-name> --region europe-west1-b
```
Remove storage:

```
$ gsutil ls && gsutil -m rm -r gs://<cluster-name>-<bucket-name>
```
Remove service accounts:

```
$ gcloud iam service-accounts list && gcloud iam service-accounts delete <name>@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Cleanup the local configuration:

```
$ rm -rvf ~/.jx
```
